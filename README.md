Our project Hospital Management system includes the registration of patients, 
storing their details in the system, and also booking their appointments with 
doctors. Our software can give a unique id for every patient and automatically 
stores the details of every patient and the Doctor. Users can search for the 
availability of a doctor and the details of a patient using the id. The Hospital 
Management System can be entered using a username and password. Only they 
can add data to the database. The data can be retrieved easily. The interface is 
very user-friendly. The data are well protected for personal use and make the 
data processing very fast. It is having mainly two modules. One is at 
Administration Level and the other is for users, I.e., patients and doctors. The 
Application maintains authentication to access the application. Administrator 
task includes managing doctor’s information, and patients’ information. To 
achieve this aim a database was designed one for the patient and the other for 
the doctors which the admin can access. The complaints which are given by 
users will be referred by authorities. The Patient modules include checking 
appointments, and prescriptions.
